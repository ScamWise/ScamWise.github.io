Welcome to Scam Wise Podcast, where host Jessie takes you deep into the hidden world of scams and cyber slavery in Southeast Asia. In this gripping episode, Jessie exposes a billion-dollar industry thriving in secrecy—a web of compounds where trafficked individuals are forced into cyber scams under brutal conditions. Through powerful storytelling, Jessie introduces listeners to the underground compounds on the borders of Thailand, Myanmar, and Cambodia, where organized crime syndicates run &quot;scam factories.&quot; Many of those working in these compounds were lured with false promises or trafficked from other countries, then trapped in a life of deceit, forced to con innocent people worldwide. Those who fail to meet their quotas face harsh punishments, including torture. Escape is nearly impossible, with families often forced to pay staggering ransoms to see their loved ones freed. Join Jessie on a journey to the heart of these compounds, where we meet a courageous rescuer risking his life to free the enslaved, volunteers fighting the rise of cyber slavery, and families left devastated by the ruthless industry. We’ll also hear from insiders, former scammers themselves, who reveal the twisted tactics used to prey on unsuspecting victims through romance and cryptocurrency scams. This eye-opening episode dives into the urgent need to confront these compounds, exposing their existence as a global crisis affecting millions. As Scam Wise Podcast uncovers the truth, listeners are reminded of the power of awareness and vigilance. |

In this eye-opening episode of the Scam Wise Podcast, host Jessie dives into one of the most heart-wrenching scams out there—the &quot;ghost dependent scam.&quot; This scam preys on grieving families by exploiting the identities of deceased children. Scammers use obituary information to gather personal details of recently deceased children, going as far as to obtain Social Security numbers. Armed with this information, they file fraudulent tax returns to claim these children as dependents, pocketing tax refunds meant for honest taxpayers. But it doesn’t stop there. Many of these stolen Social Security numbers are sold on the dark web, opening the door to further identity theft and financial crimes that affect innocent families long after they’ve said goodbye to their loved ones. In this episode, Jessie explores how this scam operates, shares real-life accounts, and offers essential steps to protect yourself if you experience a loss. Listen in as Jessie unpacks this disturbing scam, reminding us that even in our most vulnerable moments, we can take action to shield ourselves and our families. From filing with the Social Security Administration to locking down critical personal information, this episode arms you with the knowledge to stay safe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
